== Homeworks

In homeworks, my target was to deploy OpenStack to virtual machines hosted on our school infrastructure. Then, I inspected various aspect of this OpenStack, ran some Docker containers and analysed network between the virtual machines. Last, bonus homework was for deploying Kubernetes on the virtual machines.
