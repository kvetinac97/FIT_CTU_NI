= HW5 â€“ Data access

In this task, we will fill the table with possible access technologies for methods GET and DELETE.

|====
<h| Resource                      <h| Format <h| GET             <h| DELETE
  | http://company.at/customers     | XML      | CORS, REST        | CORS, REST
  | http://company.at/suppliers     | JSON     | CORS, REST, JSONP | CORS, REST
  | http://weather.at/innsbruck     | XML      | CORS              | CORS
  | http://people.at/students       | JSON     | CORS, JSONP       | CORS
  | http://people.at/\{dob}/contact | VCARD    | CORS              | CORS
|====

To access each resource, we can use the CORS access technology, which has no limitations here.

For the first two resources, we can use REST, which supports both XML and JSON format. However, as the other resources are not on same origin (company.at), we are *not* able to use REST here as we would be *blocked* by the same origin policy.

And at last, we can use JSONP for *GET* requests on resources in JSON format.
