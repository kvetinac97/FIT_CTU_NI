= HW7 â€“ Server Sent Events

In this task, I created a simple Node.js server and client to demonstrate Server Sent Events.

After connection, the server sends messages to client in interval of 2 seconds.

The SSE requires `text/event-stream` content type and keep-alive connection.

Client is a simple HTML webpage, which starts connection and displays incoming lines in an unordered list.
