= ATHENS course

I participated in ATHENS course in March 2023 at Mines Paris for C++ programming course (MP01).

Throughout lectures, we heard some details about C++ language with some examples (`codes/`).

Then, we had to do a final project to get a grade. xref:final/[See the final project].

I got *grade A* from the ATHENS course.
