= Parallel and Distributed Programming

Got 100 % from semestral work with bonus points for efficient solution. +
Got 87 % from oral exam, resulting in grade *A*.

== Exam

All 52 questions for oral exam in one PDF file, summarized for better learning.

== Semestral

The semestral work was to implement an algorithm for finding a bipartite continuos subgraph of an edge-valued graph with maximum weight.

At first, we should have implemented the algorithm sequentially, with incremental updates incoming -- firstly using task parallelism, then data parallelism and finally by using a distributed computing cluster Star. I finally measured the efficiency of my solution and analyzed it.
